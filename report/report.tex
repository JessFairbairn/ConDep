    A system was developed to perform two way conversion from natural language to actions, and from actions to natural language.

    The first step is parsing a natural language event into a predicate-argument structure relating subject and object. Each verb sense will have a definition in terms of conceptual dependencies- which CD primitive it corresponds to, which physical attribute it affects (e.g.~the `eject' verb indicates the object has been removed from inside the subject, meaning an `inside\_subject' attribute is assigned to that verb).

    Each verb definition will have a CD primitive associated with it- each of these primitives will have it's own properties such as the attribute it affects, and any constraints on the subject/ object type. The verb definition is then merged with the primitive definition (there should be no contradictory fields).
