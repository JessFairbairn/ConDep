## Introduction
## Background
* [ ] NLP -> FOs, using argument roles

### Conceptual Dependencies
- [ ] Introduce general concept
- [ ] Strengths
- [ ] Possibility of applying ML
- [ ] Comments on possibly redundant primitives

## Implementation
### Natural language to Actions
- event into predicate argument
    - identify verb sense
    - [ ] apply nlp to work out various roles of each argument
    - find corresponding prim

- info from prim assigned to verb sense
    - affected_attribute, constraints
    - merging verb and prim definitions

- emit/eject example for different verbs with same primitive

- constraints (maybe)

### Actions to Natural Language
- Simulation reports events

- filtering primitives first then filtering verbs
### Physics Simulation
- [ ] Compound Entity
- [ ] Details about tracking various properties
- [ ] Spawning action events

## Results

## Discussion

## Conclusion
### Future Work
- ML
