# Dissertation Plan

## Introduction

## Background
- [ ] NLP -> FOs, using argument roles

### Conceptual Dependencies
- [x] Introduce general concept
- Explain primitives
- Strengths
    - [X] Syntax independent
    - [x] Metaphor- fits with our 'metaphor' based understanding of the world
    - [ ] Possibility of applying ML
- Criticisms
    - [ ] Comments on possibly redundant primitives
    - [ ] Abandoning primitives altogether

## Implementation

### Primitives
- [X] Only using subset
    - [X] Redundent primitives? 
### Natural language to Actions
- event into predicate argument
    - identify verb sense
    - [ ] apply nlp to work out various roles of each argument
    - find corresponding prim

- info from prim assigned to verb sense
    - affected_attribute, constraints
    - merging verb and prim definitions

- emit/eject example for different verbs with same primitive

- constraints (maybe)

### Actions to Natural Language
- Simulation reports events

- filtering primitives first then filtering verbs
  
### Physics Simulation
- [ ] Compound Entity
- [ ] Details about tracking various properties
- [ ] Spawning action events

### Predicate Argument Conclusions from CD
* [ ] Theory/ templates for events
* [ ] Code

## Results

## Discussion

## Conclusion

### Future Work
- ML
